Take the relationship between a person, a company, and an industry.
Components are basically people. Each component, or person, has their own job to do. When enough people are put together, you get a company.
The company is the gameObject. It's made up of many individual, smaller elements that do work in different fields, all to make the company run. 
When you have a bunch of companies, it's now an industry. Industries are the equivalent to scenes. Similar to the formation of a company, 
many different companies-whether they are directly related or not-will form an industry as they interact with each other.
